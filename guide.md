### Things you should think before coming to quarantine. 

I know, this is not something you decided so it seems there's not much you can do about it, unless of course you [got the means](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3131324/residents-luxury-hong-kong-housing-block-question).

- First of all, do not accept to be transfered to any place before you get your [quarantine order](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap599E?xpid=ID_1584520337021_049). Otherwise you would be coerced.  
  - A quarantine order must specify the terms of quarantine.
    - **This is quite important** because you want to understand wthe terms before agree, otherwise you can suffer what people from the case **11773** where some people where told they release date was on May 21st and others were told May 20th (only a few of them knew they should request a quarantine order)
  - An authorized officer may vary the terms of quarantine specified in a quarantine order.
- Ok, you know the terms, you know where where are you going and for how long, the facilities can provide you with a [handful amount of items](./items.md) that you will require during your stay, so here is what you could bring too.
  - Your favorite pillow, the facilities have pillows and blankets but they aren't really [good enough](./complaints.md)
  - Clothes (I know its obvious but the less we assume the better), get as many as you can, and as light as it possible cause it wont be easy to wash here
    - detergent for your clothes (although maybe your friends can [bring some](./pb/delivery.md) some later on)
  - deodorant, toothbrush etc. 
  - cups 
  - a power strip
  - all your chargers (you will spend enough time on your devices)
  - books 
  - board games 
  - your mobile LOL
  - computers (laptops I won't suggest to take your PC gamer with you)
  - maybe you can also pack your game console, Nintendo Switch will be the easiest but I'm sure you can pack your play station 4 (maybe PS5 is too big) 
  - SIM cards with enough data (there's no wifi in this places) if your mobile data can be shared and it's enough then you are ok
  - Do you like alcoholic refreshments? pack some as you won't be allowed to get anything after you join. 
  


If you forget to bring something don't worry your family or friends can help you deliverin something to you. Unless is something really big that might be super difficult.
