## List of complaints from the inmates 

- We were unlawfully detained in the camp without a proper quarantine order[1]. 
- We were transfered since the early morning on April 30th for 21 days, however some official documents refer to May 21st as our release date. (Which is ultimately more than 21 days)
- Inneficient catering service, some of the inmates aren't getting food on time, after hours of not having food people need to scream from their window to get some food. On the other hand other units receive more food than they need producing waste.
- The whole tower was tested and everyone was found negative and we were still detained.
- Families were separated due to lack of proper family units.
- Bedsheets, blankets and pillow covers are old and smelly and sometimes aren't enough.
- Unconmfortable beds even for pregnant woman.
