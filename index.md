## Caribbean Coast Tower 11 Quarantine Cheat Sheet

This document tries to fit FAQ for inmates of Penny Bay and LYM. A lot of information has been shared across whatsapp, however linear conversation tools aren't always the right place to search for historical help, and we all keep repeating ourselves over and over.

### FAQ

- **Some persons have received their official notice, how do I get mine?**
  - Execute your right to have an official notice by sending a message to [+852 5195 6970](whatsapp://send?abid=+85251956970&text=We%20are%20being%20unlawfuly%20detained%20in%20the%20camp%20for%20several%20days%20already.%20We%20haven%27t%20seen%20our%20quarantine%20orders%20yet.%20Send%20us%20orders%20or%20we%20are%20walking%20away.)
  - Your official note must say the period of time you are supposed to be on quarantine

    A good example to demmand the document:
    
    > "We are being unlawfuly detained in the camp for several days already. We haven't seen our quarantine orders yet. Send us orders or we are walking away."
- **Why is my floor wet & sticky?**
  - It seems to be some sort of desinfectant which is sticky and wet. Recommendation is to mop the flor and set the Aircon to dry mode with vents facing down.
