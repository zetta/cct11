# Item delivery in Penny Bay


Any item entering the camp must be applied for approval. 

- Option (a):
**pre-approval** ~ apply 24 hours in advance before delivery through whatsapp 
- Option (b) 
**on-site approval** ~ fill in the form at entrance upon delivery (but have to wait around 20 minutes for approval)  

To obtain pre-approval, please provide below information for application:
a. Item photos;
b. Item list;
c. Delivery person's name;
d. Delivery date and time
e. The delivery person's car plate (if any)

Any undeclared items are not allowed to enter the camp, please be careful to list out ALL items. 

Remember, to obtain pre-approval, please apply 24 hours before delivery

🌟 **I personally recommend use option b) and approve on site** 🌟
